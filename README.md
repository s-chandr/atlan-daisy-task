## :rocket: Task 1 (Great Task)
 ```shell
One of our clients wanted to search for slangs (in local language) for an answer to a text question
on the basis of cities (which was the answer to a different MCQ question).



```
### Various Approches/ideas : -

## :rocket: Task 2 
 ```shell
A market research agency wanted to validate responses coming in against a set of business rules 
(eg. monthly savings cannot be more than monthly income) and send the response back to the data collector 
to fix it when the rules generate a flag.



```
### Various Approches/ideas : -

## :rocket: Task 3 
 ```shell
A very common need for organizations is wanting all their data onto Google Sheets, wherein they could
connect their CRM, and also generate graphs and charts offered by Sheets out of the box. In such cases,
each response to the form becomes a row in the sheet, and questions in the form become columns. 



```
### Various Approches/ideas : -

## :rocket: Task 4 
 ```shell
A recent client partner wanted us to send an SMS to the customer whose details are
collected in the response as soon as the ingestion was complete reliably. The content
of the SMS consists of details of the customer, which were a part of the answers in 
the response. This customer was supposed to use this as a “receipt” for them having 
participated in the exercise
